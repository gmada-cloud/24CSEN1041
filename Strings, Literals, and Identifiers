Question

Write a Python program that reads a user’s name and age, then displays a message using string operations.

Code
# Program using string literals and operators

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

message = "Hello " + name + "!"
next_year_age = age + 1

print(message)
print("Next year you will be", next_year_age, "years old.")

Output
Enter your name: Alex
Enter your age: 20
Hello Alex!
Next year you will be 21 years old.

Observation

"Hello " and "years old" are string literals.

name, age, and message are valid identifiers.

+ is used as both string concatenation and arithmetic addition.

Python dynamically assigns data types.
