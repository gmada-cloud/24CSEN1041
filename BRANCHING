QUESTION:-
Print numbers from 1 to 10
Skip multiples of 3
Stop the loop when number becomes 8
CODE:-
for i in range (1 , 11):
    if i % 3 == 0:
        continue 
    
    if i == 8:
        break
    
    print(i)
OUTPUT:-
1
2
4
5
7
OBSERVATION :- 
continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next loop cycle.

Numbers 3 and 6 are skipped because they are multiples of 3.

break terminates the loop completely when i == 8.

Any code after break inside the loop will not execute.



QUESTION:-
Write a program to check numbers from 1 to 6.
Use pass when the number is 2.
Skip number 4 using continue.
Stop the loop when the number becomes 6 using break.
CODE:-
for i in range(1 , 7):
    if  i == 2:
        pass
    
    elif i == 4:
        continue
    
    elif i == 6:
        break
    
    print(i)
OUTPUT:-
1
2
3
5
OBSERVATION :-
pass does nothing and allows the program to continue normally.

Number 2 is printed because pass does not skip execution.

continue skips printing 4.

break stops the loop completely when i becomes 6.

pass is mainly used as a placeholder where a statement is required.
