QUESTION:-
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Skip the number 5 using continue and stop the loop when the number becomes 8 using break.
CODE:-
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 5:
        continue    # skip number 5

    if i == 8:
        break       # stop loop at 8

    print(i)
OUTPUT:-
1
2
3
4
6
7
OBSERVATION:-
continue skips only the current iteration (number 5 is not printed).

break terminates the loop completely when the value becomes 8.

Numbers after 8 are not executed.

Loop control statements change the normal flow of the loop.



QUESTION:-
Write a program to check numbers from 1 to 6.
Use pass when the number is 3, skip number 4 using continue, and stop the loop when the number becomes 6 using break.
CODE:-
for i in range(1, 7):
    if i == 3:
        pass        # no action performed

    elif i == 4:
        continue    # skip number 4

    elif i == 6:
        break       # stop loop

    print(i)
OUTPUT:-
1
2
3
5
OBSERVATION:-
pass does nothing and allows execution to continue normally.

Number 3 is printed because pass does not skip execution.

continue skips printing number 4.

break stops the loop completely at number 6.

pass is used as a placeholder where a statement is required.
