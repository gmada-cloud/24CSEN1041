Question

Write a Python program to demonstrate string creation, indexing, slicing, and string methods using f-strings.
Code
s1 = "Python"
s2 = "Programming"

print(f"s1 = {s1}")
print(f"s2 = {s2}")

# Indexing
print("First character of s1:", s1[0])
print("Last character of s2:", s2[-1])

# Concatenation using f-string
s3 = f"{s1} {s2}"
print("Concatenated string:", s3)

# Slicing
print("First 6 characters:", s3[:6])
print("Reverse string:", s3[::-1])

# String methods
print("Uppercase:", s3.upper())
print("Lowercase:", s3.lower())
print("Title case:", s3.title())
Output
s1 = Python
s2 = Programming
First character of s1: P
Last character of s2: g
Concatenated string: Python Programming
First 6 characters: Python
Reverse string: gnimmargorP nohtyP
Uppercase: PYTHON PROGRAMMING
Lowercase: python programming
Title case: Python Programming
Observation

This program shows how f-strings simplify string formatting and how slicing and case-conversion methods work on strings.





Question

Write a Python program to perform string operations using user input.
Code
name = input("Enter your name: ")
course = input("Enter your course: ")

message = "Hello " + name + ", welcome to " + course
print(message)

print("Length of message:", len(message))
print("Uppercase:", message.upper())
print("Does message contain 'welcome'?", "welcome" in message)
Output
Enter your name: Alex
Enter your course: Python
Hello Alex, welcome to Python
Length of message: 29
Uppercase: HELLO ALEX, WELCOME TO PYTHON
Does message contain 'welcome'? True
Observation

Strings can be dynamically created using input(), and operations like membership testing and case conversion can be easily applied.





Question

Write a Python program to demonstrate string indexing, slicing, and traversal using a loop.
Code
text = "ComputerScience"

print("Text:", text)
print("First character:", text[0])
print("Last character:", text[-1])

print("Characters at even positions:", text[::2])
print("Reverse string:", text[::-1])

print("Traversing string:")
for ch in text:
    print(ch, end=" ")
Output
Text: ComputerScience
First character: C
Last character: e
Characters at even positions: CmueSine
Reverse string: ecneicSretupmoC
Traversing string:
C o m p u t e r S c i e n c e
Observation

Strings support indexing, slicing, and iteration, making them easy to process character by character.









Question

Write a Python program to demonstrate various string methods such as split(), join(), replace(), and count().
Code
sentence = "Python is simple and Python is powerful"

print("Sentence:", sentence)

words = sentence.split()
print("Split words:", words)

joined = "_".join(words)
print("Joined string:", joined)

print("Replace 'Python' with 'Java':",
      sentence.replace("Python", "Java"))

print("Count of 'is':", sentence.count("is"))
Output
Sentence: Python is simple and Python is powerful
Split words: ['Python', 'is', 'simple', 'and', 'Python', 'is', 'powerful']
Joined string: Python_is_simple_and_Python_is_powerful
Replace 'Python' with 'Java': Java is simple and Java is powerful
Count of 'is': 2
Observation

String methods allow easy manipulation of text, including splitting into words, joining strings, replacing content, and counting occurrences.
