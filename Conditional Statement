STATEMENT:-
Write a program to display numbers from 1 to 20 with the following conditions:
If the number is divisible by both 2 and 3, skip it using continue
If the number is greater than 15 and odd, stop the loop using break
If the number is less than 5, use pass
Print all remaining numbers
CODE:-
for i in range(1 , 21):
    if i % 2 == 0 and i % 3 == 0:
        continue            # skip numbers divided by 2 and 3
    elif i > 15 and i % 2 != 0:
        break               # sto loop at odd number > 15
    elif i < 5:
        pass                # no action
    
    print(i)
OUTPUT:-
1
2
3
4
5
7
8
9
10
11
13
14
15
16
OBSERVATION:-
continue skips numbers like 6 and 12.

pass does nothing; numbers less than 5 are printed normally.

break stops the loop when i becomes 17.

Proper ordering of conditions is necessary to get correct output.





STATEMENT:-
Write a program to process numbers from 1 to 25 based on the following rules:
If the number is a multiple of 5 but not of 10, skip it using continue
If the number is greater than 18 and even, terminate the loop using break
If the number is a single-digit odd number, use pass
Print all valid numbers
CODE:-
for i in range(1, 26):
    if i % 5 == 0 and i % 10 != 0:
        continue          # skip multiples of 5 except 10, 20

    elif i > 18 and i % 2 == 0:
        break             # stop loop at even number > 18

    elif i < 10 and i % 2 != 0:
        pass              # placeholder

    print(i)
OUTPUT:-
1
2
3
4
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
16
17
18
19
OBSERVATION:-
continue skips 5 and 15.

pass does not affect execution; single-digit odd numbers are printed.

break stops the loop at 20.

Combining multiple conditions increases program complexity and requires careful logic.
