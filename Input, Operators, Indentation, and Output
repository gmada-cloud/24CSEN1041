Question

Write a Python program that reads two numbers from the keyboard, performs arithmetic operations, and prints the results in a formatted way.

Code
# Program to perform arithmetic operations

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

if b != 0:
    sum_val = a + b
    diff = a - b
    product = a * b
    quotient = a / b

    print("Sum =", sum_val)
    print("Difference =", diff)
    print("Product =", product)
    print("Quotient =", quotient)
else:
    print("Division by zero is not allowed")

Output
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Sum = 15
Difference = 5
Product = 50
Quotient = 2.0

Observation

Python interpreter executes the program line by line.

Proper indentation is required inside the if block.

input() reads data as a string and is converted using int().

Arithmetic operators (+ - * /) are used.
