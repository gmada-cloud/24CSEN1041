Question

Demonstrate the use of Python atoms, keywords, and expressions by checking whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Code
# Program to classify a number

num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

if num > 0:
    result = "Positive"
elif num < 0:
    result = "Negative"
else:
    result = "Zero"

print("The number is", result)

Output
Enter a number: -3
The number is Negative

Observation

Numbers and strings used here are atoms.

if, elif, and else are keywords.

Python shell evaluates expressions like num > 0.

Indentation controls program flow.
